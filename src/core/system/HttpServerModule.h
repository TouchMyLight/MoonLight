class JsonSink;   // forward declared: the bodies in the .cpp include the real headers
class Scheduler;

/// The embedded HTTP server and WebSocket: it serves the web UI and the REST API behind it.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## What it is allowed to include
///
/// This is core infrastructure held to a light-include-free contract, with one accepted exception.
/// The WLED-compatibility shim's color path uses the pure hue and palette-index conversions in `light/Palette.h`, `Palettes::nearestForRgb` and `Palettes::representativeRgb`.
/// `MqttModule` documents the same sanctioned exception at its own top.
/// Routing a HomeKit or Home Assistant WLED color to a MoonLight palette needs the palette set, which is inherently light-domain, and a format conversion is the least-coupling bridge.
/// This module still drives the palette through `Scheduler::setControl` rather than a light object, and no other light-domain include is permitted.
///
/// The implementation lives in the `.cpp`, and this header is the interface alone.
/// The `port` control defaults to 8080 on the desktop and 80 on an ESP32.
///
/// ## The REST API
///
/// `GET /` serves `index.html` and the UI assets.
///
/// | Route | What it returns |
/// |-------|-----------------|
/// | `GET /api/state` | the full module-tree JSON: per entry a name, type, role, enabled flag, tick time, sizes, controls, and any status |
/// | `GET /api/system` | frame rate, tick time, free heap, free internal, largest block, uptime |
/// | `GET /api/types` | the type catalog: a stable factory name, a display name, the child roles a type accepts, and defaults from a fresh probe instance |
///
/// ## Mutations and the File Manager
///
/// A mutation is `POST /api/control` with a module, control and value; `POST /api/modules` to create; `POST /api/modules/{name}/move` to reorder and `.../replace` to swap; `POST /api/reboot`; or `DELETE /api/modules/{name}`.
///
/// The File Manager reads and writes through `GET|POST /api/file?path=`, and lists, creates and removes through `/api/dir?path=`.
/// The path rides the query, so a filesystem operation carries its target in the request rather than in a stored control.
/// SD Card (boards with a slot) is the same shape on its own mount: `GET|POST /api/sdfile?path=`, list/create/remove through `/api/sddir?path=`.
///
/// Every JSON response streams through a `JsonSink`, so there is no fixed-buffer ceiling and a tree of any size serializes correctly.
///
/// ## The two WebSocket channels
///
/// `GET /ws` with an `Upgrade: websocket` header does the RFC 6455 handshake, SHA-1 and base64.
/// Traffic is split by class across two channels sharing one lwIP socket budget, each with its own cap.
/// `/ws` carries the control plane, the JSON state and its patches, and `/wsp` the lossy binary preview stream.
///
/// Every binary message takes one path: the resumable buffered send.
/// It drains a memory-adaptive chunk per client per 20 ms tick, from a stable caller-owned buffer.
/// A large frame is therefore delivered across wall-clock ticks without any loop waiting on a socket, while staying one atomic WebSocket message.
/// One buffered send is in flight per slot at a time, newest-wins: a new offer arriving while one is active is dropped.
/// A client is closed only on a real error or a FIN, never for being slow.
///
/// ## What a preview client may send back
///
/// Inbound `/wsp` payloads are unmasked and handed opaquely to the registered producer sink, whose vocabulary is a standing frame request and a one-shot table request.
/// Every other mutation goes through REST.
///
/// ## State push: a diff on the wire
///
/// This is the recognizable snapshot-then-patch model, the shape Redux and Firestore sync use and RFC 6902 formalises.
///
/// The state a client needs is the full module tree, around 30 KB and mostly unchanging option and detail metadata.
/// Re-serializing all of it every second, inline on the render thread, stole render budget and stuttered the LEDs at 1 Hz.
///
/// So a client gets the full state once on connect, chunk-drained through the resumable sender and off the render tick.
/// Each second after that it gets a patch carrying only the values that changed.
/// Change is found by value-compare rather than a dirty flag: each leaf's value is serialized, hashed with FNV-1a, and compared against a cached hash.
/// A value the device mutates itself, telemetry or a status or a driver, is therefore caught exactly like a `setControl` write.
/// No per-write instrumentation is needed.
///
/// ## How a leaf is named
///
/// A leaf path is the module name and the control name, or an `@`-prefixed field for live per-card header telemetry.
/// Module names are unique tree-wide, so a path is stable.
///
/// ## When a patch cannot describe the change
///
/// The hash cache is one global baseline rather than one per client, held in a growable scratch buffer.
/// A full resync re-sends the whole state and re-baselines.
/// That happens on connect and after any structural change, since a value patch cannot describe a reshaped tree.
///
/// A schema change forces one too, through a static schema-changed hook.
/// The value patch carries no changed hidden flags or option sets.
/// Any `rebuildControls` triggers it: a control set, a list mutation, an asynchronous WiFi or Hue callback.
///
/// A pending resync is fast-pathed on the 20 ms tick rather than only the 1 s one, and preempts an in-flight preview frame.
/// A freshly connected client therefore gets its state, and so its preview, within tens of milliseconds rather than up to a second.
///
/// ## What the diff buys
///
/// The net effect is a per-second push falling from about 34 KB to one or two.
/// The expensive full-tree serialize runs only on connect or a schema change.
/// The UI applies a patch in place, with no rebuild, and re-renders on a full frame.
/// That is the sub-hot-path rule applied: a periodic tick shares the render thread, so its work must be cheap or skipped when nothing changed.
///
/// ## Why the drain runs on the transport tick
///
/// The resumable drain runs on the 20 ms transport poll and deliberately not the per-render `tick`.
/// Pushing preview bytes to a socket is therefore never charged to the LED render hot path.
/// The LED output is never delayed by the preview.
/// The preview frame rate is instead bounded by the 20 ms drain cadence, which is the right trade: the preview is a view and the LEDs are not.
///
/// ## The WLED-compatibility shim
///
/// A small set of WLED-shaped messages make a MoonLight device appear in the native WLED apps and Home Assistant's WLED integration, and be controlled from them.
///
/// Discovery is over mDNS.
/// Validation is a minimal `GET /json/info` carrying a name, a MAC, LED and WiFi objects, and the brand and product fields.
/// The app keys on the brand to accept a device: we interoperate rather than impersonate, and this is no full WLED emulation.
///
/// Live state is pushed over `/ws` as a state-and-info frame.
/// The state mirrors the Drivers brightness control and the live first-LED color, falling back to MoonLight purple when the first LED is off.
///
/// Control is bidirectional over that same socket.
/// The app's slider and toggle send a frame that is read and applied to Drivers brightness through the shared apply core, the path REST and Improv also use.
///
/// ## The one reach into output state
///
/// The color read is the one place this core module reaches output state, through `MoonModule::firstOutputRgb`, a domain-neutral virtual the light-domain Drivers overrides.
/// That is what keeps this module free of a light-domain include.
///
/// ## Reading an uplink frame, and taking the lease
///
/// The uplink parser handles RFC 6455 framing alone, and the payload's meaning belongs to the registered sink.
/// It returns a payload length, or -1 when the buffer holds no complete frame.
/// It also reports how many bytes the whole frame consumed, so a caller can walk a read that coalesced several.
/// It is pure and static, so the byte handling is unit-tested without a socket.
///
/// The sender lease guards the send state and the socket writes against this module's own core-0 drain and state push, while an offloaded `PreviewDriver` streams from core 1.
/// It try-locks rather than waits: a busy transport returns false and the producer skips that frame.
///
/// ## The per-module state route
///
/// One module's JSON is served on its own route, byte-identical to that module's entry in the full state, children included.
/// The UI puts a link to it on every card, so an issue report can carry the state of the one module that misbehaves rather than the whole tree.
/// A name in the path may be percent-encoded, since a module name can carry a space.
///
/// ## Two firmware install paths
///
/// A firmware URL is answered at once and installed on its own task, so the browser polls for progress rather than holding a request open.
/// On a MoonBase device the URL is staged in NVS and the device reboots into MoonBase, which installs it unattended; otherwise the platform fetches straight to the OTA slot.
///
/// Installing a new MoonBase into the factory slot is the mirror of that, and the only way to fix a broken recovery image without a cable.
/// It vets the image before erasing anything and deliberately does not reboot, so the running app is untouched.
/// The URL form of it is what makes a release asset installable without the browser relaying most of a megabyte.
///
/// ## Crossing the domain boundary
///
/// This module exposes the `BinaryBroadcaster` interface, and the light-domain `PreviewDriver` holds a pointer to it and streams each frame's bytes through it.
/// `main.cpp` wires the two together, being the only file that knows both, and the preview's point budget and wire format are the driver's concern.
///
/// ## The apply core: the REST API, callable in process
///
/// The add, set and clear-children operations are factored out of the connection so any transport can drive them.
/// Two do today: the HTTP handlers, thin wrappers mapping a result onto a status code, and the Improv serial path, which applies a pushed op on the main loop.
/// That gives the apply logic one home, and transports differ only in how they frame a request and report its result.
///
/// A file write is the second way persistent state changes, so it ends in the same request that a control write does.
/// Putting it here rather than in whichever client remembers to send a follow-up nudge is what makes it reliable, since `curl` and MoonDeck would not.
///
/// The re-derive asks the whole tree rather than consulting a path-to-module registry, which would need an association nothing else in the system keeps.
/// A module decides for itself whether what it holds actually changed.
/// `prepare` is the cold path that exists to be re-entered, and a scripted module compares a content hash rather than re-reading its source.
/// The path is accepted for diagnostics and a future narrower dispatch; today every successful write asks the same question.
///
/// ## Two guards that are static on purpose
///
/// The filesystem path decoder is the single guard every filesystem entry shares, for reads, writes, listings, directory creation and deletion.
/// It refuses a missing or empty path, a `..` traversal, and an overlong value that would fill the buffer.
///
/// The header lookup is case-insensitive because RFC 9112 says field names are.
/// Browsers send one spelling and node's client another, and the case-sensitive search this replaced silently read a length of zero and committed empty files with a 200.
///
/// Both are public and static so the byte handling is unit-tested without a socket fixture.
///
/// ## What the preview lock guards, and what it does not
///
/// The lock covers the preview channel's shared state, its send bookkeeping and its sockets, because those have producers on two cores once the multicore split engages.
/// Core 1 arms frames and streams the coordinate table from the offloaded driver's tick, while core 0 touches the same sockets in the drain, the uplink reap and admission.
///
/// Three things go wrong without it.
/// A partial write on one core interleaves with the other inside a single frame and corrupts the framing.
/// A close lands under a concurrent write on the same descriptor.
/// Or one side observes torn send state.
///
/// The control channel is deliberately outside its scope, since every writer there runs on core 0.
/// It try-locks and never blocks: whichever core loses the race skips its slot, which the hot-path rule requires.
/// A lost race costs one preview frame, or defers a reap or an admission by a tick, and never stalls a render or an encode.
///
/// ## The served port is not the port control
///
/// `servedPort` reports what the listener actually bound, or zero when none is up, and it is the one true source for any module that must print its own URL.
/// The `port` control is mutable and says what was asked for, which is a different question.
///
/// The schema hook can be installed without opening the listener.
/// A unit test proving the hook fires a resync needs no socket, and binding a port under test is flaky when that port is busy.
/// A release unwires it exactly as it would after a real setup.
///
/// ## How the two channel caps are sized
///
/// The control channel allows eight clients, sized for a few concurrent viewers plus the transient overlap when one refreshes.
/// A browser opens the new socket before the OS delivers the old one's FIN, so both briefly hold a slot.
/// The dead one is reaped within a tick or two, on its next failed send.
/// At four, a couple of quick refreshes filled every slot with not-yet-reaped connections and the new upgrade was rejected outright.
/// Eight leaves headroom so a refresh always lands a slot, and a slot is only a descriptor and a small cursor.
///
/// ## Why the preview cap is lower
///
/// The preview channel allows four, deliberately fewer.
/// Both arrays draw on one lwIP socket budget of sixteen, shared with HTTP, mDNS, Art-Net, MQTT and OTA.
/// A preview socket per control client would consume the whole budget at the cap and starve the rest.
/// Four is sized from observed use: one browser almost always, two often enough that it must simply work, more only occasionally.
/// A REST caller such as Home Assistant never opens a preview socket at all.
/// A refused upgrade costs that client only its preview, leaving its control connection untouched.
///
/// ## Why the preview has its own connections
///
/// They are separate TCP connections, so a 10 KB preview frame can never delay a state push.
/// That is the standard remedy for the head-of-line blocking one socket carrying both traffic classes produces.
///
/// The state push has its own send slot for the same reason.
/// Sharing the preview's routed the full state to the preview channel and starved every control client of its resync.
/// The preview's body is borrowed rather than owned, the producer keeping its pixel buffer alive and cancelling before a resize frees it.
/// The header buffer is 24 bytes and not 16: a payload over 64 KB takes the ten-byte length form, and the app headers add eleven more.
/// At 16, every uncapped-size frame was silently refused.
///
/// ## Why the sink helpers are members
///
/// The `JsonSink` helpers below are private members rather than free functions, because each reads this module's own state or calls another of its members.
///
/// Three pieces live in their own headers, all in the same namespace so the call sites are unchanged.
/// They are the sink itself with its escaping writer, the SHA-1 of RFC 3174 for the handshake, and the base64 encoder the handshake and password obfuscation share.
///
/// ## Prior art
///
/// The shim's exact field requirements were reverse-engineered from the [WLED-Android client](https://github.com/Moustachauve/WLED-Android) by Christophe Gagnier.
/// Its mDNS browse, its `/json/info` validation with a non-empty MAC check, its models and its live-state socket client told us precisely what the app reads.
/// Knowing that is why the shim is the minimal accepted object rather than a guessed full emulation.
