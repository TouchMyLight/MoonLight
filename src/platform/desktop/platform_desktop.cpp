/// @defgroup platform_desktop The desktop platform layer
/// Every platform seam on macOS, Windows and Linux, so the desktop build runs what a device runs.
///
/// Where a host has the facility it is real: sockets, the filesystem, executable memory, raw frames.
/// Where it has no silicon the seam is backed by ordinary memory instead of refused, which is what keeps the drivers above testable off device.
///
/// @moreinfo
///
/// ## A host bus is real memory, not a refusal
///
/// The parallel output seams used to return failure, so a driver body of some 2500 lines never executed off device.
/// It was not runnable, not testable, and invisible to every syntax-tree check.
/// So a bus is implemented against a heap buffer: init allocates, buffer hands back writable memory, transmit records the byte count, wait returns at once.
/// Everything above the seam is then the same code that runs on hardware, and only the hand-off is absent.
///
/// Deliberately not modelled: timing, wire protocol, pin state and loopback capture.
/// Those need silicon, and faking them would make a driver's self-test lie about hardware it never touched.
/// HUB75 is the exception that stays inert, having no host analogue worth faking, and its encoder is already tested on plain buffers.
///
/// ## The identity is stored, not read from a NIC
///
/// The address is generated once and kept beside the config, which is the pattern systemd uses for its machine identity.
/// It matters because the address is an identity rather than a diagnostic: the device name, the MQTT topic prefix and the Home Assistant identifier all derive from it.
/// A hardcoded value made every desktop instance the same one, so two desktops or a handful of containers were indistinguishable and fought over one entity.
/// Home Assistant requires that such an identifier survive container recreation, which storing it achieves and reading a host interface does not.
/// This Mac lists an internal management interface before its real one, and containers sharing a bridge can present related addresses.
///
/// The address is locally administered and unicast, the range set aside for addresses that are not vendor-assigned, so it cannot collide with real hardware.
/// Existing installs keep their identity: a tree with no identity file but with config is seeded with the historic value, so an upgrade never renames a device.
/// The write is atomic like every other config write, since a torn line would be rejected on the next start and the device would silently take a different identity.
///
/// ## The data root is per-user, not relative
///
/// A shipped binary is launched from a download folder, a menu shortcut or an installer's directory.
/// A relative root fails both ways.
/// It lands somewhere unwritable, so every save fails, or it makes the settings belong to that folder rather than to the user, so moving the executable loses them.
/// Both were seen on a Windows bench. Three sources are tried in order: an explicit override, a repo checkout, then the operating system's per-user application data.
///
/// A checkout is recognized by two markers together, because one of them is true in the root of every CMake project there is.
/// A developer whose shell sits in an unrelated one would otherwise get this project's settings written into that project's build directory.
/// It keys on the working directory rather than the executable's location, since that is the development loop this preserves and an installed copy is never launched that way.
///
/// ## The raw-frame driver is loaded, not linked
///
/// Windows has no kernel path for sending a raw layer-two frame: it takes a third-party driver, which ColorLight's own software also uses.
/// The library is resolved at run time rather than linked, and that is deliberate. This layer is a public dependency of the core, the application and both test binaries.
/// Linking it would make that vendor's kit a build requirement for continuous integration and for every contributor, to compile a path most of them never run.
/// Loading on demand means the binary builds and runs identically without it, and reports that raw send is unavailable instead of failing to link.
/// The whole surface is five functions, declared with the library's own signatures rather than by including its header, which would reintroduce the dependency this avoids.
///
/// ## Interface labels carry the negotiated speed
///
/// The lookup is necessarily per-operating-system, three interfaces in three units, which is what this layer is for.
/// The rendering is not, so it lives here once.
/// The label shape is a contract that the apply path and the driver's remap both parse, to recover the adapter's stable identity.
/// Two copies would be two chances to drift out of that agreement.
/// A speed of zero means the system would not state one, for a virtual adapter or a link that is down, and that appends nothing rather than a fabricated figure.
/// It appends only if the whole suffix fits, since a truncated speed reads worse than none and the label is what the selection persists by.
///
/// ## Config files are written owner-only
///
/// The standard open creates a file the process umask widens, so on a typical one it lands world-readable.
/// These are the config files, which hold network keys and broker passwords, and a desktop runs on a real machine with real other users.
/// A device is unaffected: its filesystem has no modes at all.
///
/// One platform gets an exclusive create with an explicit mode.
/// Exclusive, because a pre-existing file at one of these paths is either a crashed run's leftover or somebody else's, and inheriting its mode would defeat the point.
/// The other has no mode concept and its files inherit the directory's access list, which is that platform's own answer to the same question, so it keeps the plain open.
///
/// ## Address reuse means opposite things
///
/// On one platform the option lets a fresh socket claim a port left waiting from a closed connection, and never allows two live binds to overlap.
/// On the other its meaning is reversed: two live sockets can hold the same port, so a second bind succeeds where the retry logic expects a refusal.
/// That platform's default already matches the first one's behavior, so the option is simply not set there.
///
/// The outcome still is not uniform: on one system the option on a datagram socket bound to every address permits an overlapping bind, so a second one succeeds.
/// A test that needs a bind to fail must use the test override rather than holding the port.
///
/// ## What the allocation counter is for
///
/// Not a heap figure: a desktop has as much memory as it wants.
/// And the free-heap report stays at nothing because three call sites read that as unlimited and switch off gates that only mean something on a device.
/// What it is good for is the DELTA. Every buffer the system takes on purpose comes through these entry points.
/// So adding or removing a module moves the number by exactly what that module costs, on a laptop, in a second, with no board attached.
/// The process's own resident size cannot answer that, since the allocator, the compiler and the network buffers move it too, and a small layer would be lost in the noise.
/// The REQUESTED size is recorded rather than the allocator's rounded one, so a reported delta is the number the caller asked for.
///
/// ## The render sleeps to a frame budget
///
/// Yielding alone only offers the processor to another runnable thread.
/// So on an otherwise idle machine it returns at once and the caller spins a core flat out, reported from a bench as the process slowly eating more cycles.
/// Nothing consumes a desktop render faster than a display or a driver's own rate limit.
/// So a loop free-running at thousands of frames is spending a core to compute frames nobody reads.
/// The budget is far above any output rate we drive while leaving the processor idle in between.
/// And a tick that legitimately runs longer simply gets no sleep, so a heavy grid still runs as fast as it can.
///
/// ## The video runtime's structures are transcribed, not included
///
/// The runtime is resolved on demand and never linked, bundled, or its headers included, the same arrangement as the raw-frame driver and for the same licensing reason.
/// The user installs it; a machine without it builds and runs identically and reports the feature unavailable.
///
/// So the declarations are transcribed from the vendor's own public headers.
/// Getting a field's type or ORDER wrong is a silent crash or a skewed image rather than a compile error.
/// These are passed by pointer into a binary built against the real definitions.
/// They are quoted verbatim in the plan with their source, and must not be tidied.
///
/// ## Naming an adapter when the capture library cannot
///
/// That library's own description is sometimes absent, and then the adapter is unnameable: the only text left to match is a 49-character device path.
/// So the system's own description is found through the interface table, keyed on the identifier the device path already carries.
/// The negotiated speed rides in the label too, because the name alone does not say what a picker needs to know.
/// A wall wants the gigabit adapter, and a list of plausible names hides which entries are a dongle, a radio or a virtual switch.
/// An adapter whose speed the system will not state gets no suffix rather than a fabricated one.
///
/// ## The interface table, not the address list
///
/// An adapter bound to a virtual switch does not appear in the address list at all: the system reports the virtual one and hides the physical one the switch owns.
/// Measured here, where the capture library opens a device whose identifier is in no address-list row.
/// The interface table lists the physical one and carries the same identifier, so one exact key covers both a virtualized adapter and one described as nothing at all.
/// The description cannot do that, being absent on some and filter-suffixed on others.
///
/// ## Which adapters can carry panel frames
///
/// The interface type alone is not the test: measured on a bench, the virtual switch ports, every wide-area miniport, the bridge and the personal-area network all report the same type.
/// Whether it is a hardware interface is what separates them from an adapter with a socket on it.
/// A radio fails the type test instead, which is the right answer for a card that needs a wire.
///
/// ## The link query used to be a stub
///
/// It returned false on every host but one, which made the driver report no link while it drove a card perfectly.
/// The send path was implemented and only the state query was missing, so the health check contradicted the driver's own output.
/// Reported by a user driving a card from a small board.
