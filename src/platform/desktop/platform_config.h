/// A zero makes every parallel backend report "not my silicon", so the driver idles and its body never runs off-device: not runnable, not unit-testable, invisible to every check.
/// Sixteen is the widest real rig, so the host exercises the same lane-splitting arithmetic the hardware does.
/// The bus behind them is a heap buffer, holding real WS2812 patterns in real memory, with only the DMA hand-off absent.

/// ## Types exist even where the feature does not
///
/// The platform header declares one signature per seam for every target, so the Ethernet and codec types must resolve here even though a host has neither.
/// The stubs ignore them, and shared code gates on the capability flags instead.
