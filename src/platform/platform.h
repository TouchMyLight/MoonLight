/// ## Ethernet transmit can wedge
///
/// The driver's internal link state can diverge from both the PHY and our own event-driven flag.
/// Observed on an S31 under sustained transmit, with the link genuinely lost, no disconnect event delivered, and nothing recovering short of a reboot.
/// A stop and start re-runs link negotiation, which is the only supported way back, and it blocks for up to four seconds while autonegotiation polls the PHY to its timeout.
/// The housekeeping tick calls it only where every frame is being refused anyway, so a stalled render loop for one tick costs nothing a user can see.
///
/// ## DMA cannot read PSRAM at the expander's clock
///
/// Measured fine at 2.67 MHz and never completing at 26.67 MHz, which is why a frame above the expander's cap is never materialized.
/// The streaming ring loops a small pool of internal buffers instead, and the CPU encodes the next slice into each as it drains.
///
/// ## Internal RAM for what an interrupt reads
///
/// A PSRAM-resident encode source measured about 595 microseconds per slice refill against a 151 microsecond drain budget.
/// So a buffer an interrupt reads per byte comes from `allocInternal` rather than the PSRAM-first `alloc`.
