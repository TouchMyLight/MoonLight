# Effects

Every effect, one block each: its preview, what it does, and what each control means: together. An effect writes per-pixel color into its [Layer](moxygen/Layer.md)'s buffer each tick; [modifiers](modifiers.md) reshape the result and a [driver](moxygen/PreviewDriver.md) sends it out. Effects that name an index color read the global palette (the `palette` control on [Drivers](moxygen/Drivers.md)) via `colorFromPalette`. Each block's emoji are its `tags()` (origin/creator/audio: see the [tag emoji legend](../../explanation/architecture/index.md#tag-emoji-legend)); **Dim** is its native axes ([Layer](moxygen/Layer.md) extrudes a lower-dim effect onto a bigger grid). Effects are grouped into sections by origin, and each block carries that effect's preview, behavior, and control descriptions together. How the layout here maps to the source and asset folders is the [folder-structure decision](../../contributing/documentation-standards.md#module-pages).

Effects are built from the shared [power functions](power-functions.md): the drawing, field and motion routines every effect composes; that page lists each one with its callers.

### ColorTrails 💫🖌️💨🌫️ · 3D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/ColorTrailsEffect.gif" width="300" alt="ColorTrails effect preview">

Emitters pouring color into a flow that carries and folds it. There is no velocity field: one noise value shifts each row sideways, one shifts each column, and the two shears compose into a swirling current. A large grid is steered by a few hundred numbers, which is why it runs where a solver does not.

- `speed`: how fast the emitters travel.
- `flow`: how far a row or column is pushed: the shear amount.
- `flowSpeed`: how fast the flow itself drifts and reverses.
- `scale`: the profiles' spatial frequency: a few broad bands or many fine ones.
- `persistence`: how long color survives, as a half-life.
- `colorSpeed`: how fast the emitters walk the palette.
- `size`: the orbit's radius and the Lissajous figure's reach.
- `mode`: all three emitters, or one at a time to see what each contributes.
- `flowType`: the field carrying them: `Noise`, `Radial out`, `Radial in`.

Compare with [Fluid](#fluid): the solver when the medium is the subject, this when the color is.

Audio-reactive sawtooth waves: each column maps to a frequency band whose magnitude drives a per-band oscillator speed, so louder bands sweep their sawtooth up the column faster, with three phase methods.

- `fade`: background decay per frame.
- `increaser`: how fast a band's speed ramps up with its magnitude.
- `decreaser`: how fast a silent band's speed decays.

### Fireworks 💫✨ · 2D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/FireworksEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Fireworks effect preview">

Shells rise, stall, and burst into sparks that arc over and fall. Nothing schedules the apex: the shell decelerates under gravity and bursts when its vertical velocity crosses zero, so a faster launch bursts higher without a second control.

- `launchRate`: how often a new shell goes up.
- `launchSpeed`: how hard it is thrown, and so how high it bursts.
- `gravity`: how fast everything falls, per 60 Hz of simulated time.
- `sparks`: sparks per burst.
- `sparkLife`: how long a spark survives.
- `drag`: air resistance flattening the arc.
- `fade`: trail length (the Layer's decay, not the pool's).

Physics runs on elapsed time, so the same settings behave identically at any frame rate.

### Fish Tank 💫🎶✨👾 · 2D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/FishTankEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Fish Tank effect preview">

An aquarium on a light wall: fish of three shapes swim across a dark tank, each in its own color from the active palette, tails beating. The art carries shade roles rather than fixed colors, and each fish fills them from its own place on the palette, so one drawing yields as many colorways as there are fish.

- `fish`: how many broad tropical fish (0-8).
- `slim`: how many slender fish (0-8).
- `school`: how many tiny schooling fish (0-8).
- `speed`: swim rate in body-lengths, the same on any grid.
- `spriteSize`: integer magnification; 0 is auto, scaling with the grid.
- `audioReactive`: each sprite follows its own band, so the scene breathes.

Uses the global palette, each fish's band a paler version of its own body color.

<a id="flyingtoasters"></a>

### Flying Toasters 💫🎶✨👾 · 2D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/FlyingToastersEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Flying Toasters effect preview">

The classic screensaver on a light wall: chrome toasters with flapping wings and slices of toast drift diagonally across the dark, forever. The wing flap carries a per-toaster offset, so the flock never falls into sync.

- `toasters`: how many fly (1–12).
- `toast`: how many slices trail along (0–8).
- `speed`: drift rate in sprite-widths, the same on any grid.
- `spriteSize`: integer magnification for toasters and toast; 0 is auto.
- `audioReactive`: each sprite follows its own band, so the scene breathes.

The sprites carry their own colors (chrome, wing, crust), so the global palette does not apply. Needs a grid at least the toaster's size (12×9).

Shapes placed between pixels rather than on them. A clock hand drawn on whole pixels jumps a pixel at a time and reads as broken; the same hand at a fractional position moves smoothly, because a pixel's brightness carries the fraction its position cannot.

- `demo`: which figure, or `all` to cycle them.
    Eleven figures, from a geared clock through a spirograph to boids and a swaying tree.
- `bpm`: how fast the orbits and curves run; the clock keeps its own.
- `fade`: how much of the previous frame survives, which leaves the trail.
- `dwell`: seconds each demo holds before `all` moves on.
- `drift`: how far the scene wanders from center, in pixels; 0 pins it.
- `zoom`: the camera pushes in and settles back; 0 holds it fixed.

### MovingHead 💫🎶🎯 · 1D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/MovingHeadEffect.gif" width="300" alt="MovingHead effect preview">

Aims a rig of moving heads as one instrument. Pan and tilt sweep at different rates, so a beam traces a path rather than a line, and `formation` decides how the heads relate.

The first effect that aims a fixture rather than only coloring it.

- `formation`: how the heads relate:
    **fan**, **mirror**, **chase**, **cross** and **unison**.
- `panBpm` / `tiltBpm`: sweep rates. Differing rates trace a path, not a line.
- `panRange` / `tiltRange`: how much of the fixture's travel to use.
- `panCenter` / `tiltCenter`: where the sweep is centered; 128 is the middle.
- `audioReactive`: the beam widens with the room, each head on its own band.
- `gobo` / `rotate`: the beam's wheels, as raw bytes; see the manual.
- `goboOnBeat`: roll a new gobo on a bass hit, then hold it a moment.

A fixture chain is one-dimensional, so lay the rig out as a **1 x N** grid.

The arcade cast crossing a light wall: Pacman chomps his way along while the four ghosts drift past, each in its own color, wrapping around the edges forever.

The characters travel independently, each on its own path.

- `pacmen`: how many Pacmen (0-4).
- `ghosts`: how many ghosts (0-8); the arcade cast is four.
- `speed`: travel rate in sprite-widths, the same on any grid.
- `spriteSize`: integer magnification; 0 is auto, scaling with the grid.
- `audioReactive`: each sprite follows its own band, so the scene breathes.

Pacman keeps his yellow; the ghosts take their colors from the active palette.

### Space Invaders 💫🎵👾 · 2D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/SpaceInvadersEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Space Invaders effect preview">

The 1978 formation marching down the wall: five ranks stepping sideways in the two-frame wiggle, dropping a row and reversing at each wall, and speeding up as the ranks thin. That acceleration is the defining mechanic. Invaders fire down, the cannon fires back, and a landing resets the board.

- `marchBpm`: steps per minute when full; it speeds up as the ranks thin.
- `stepX`: how far a step moves the formation sideways, in pixels.
- `dropY`: how far a wall turn drops it, in pixels.
- `size`: magnification per art pixel; 1 on a matrix, 2 or more on a wall.
- `audioReactive`: the formation steps on transients, locking to the track.

The invaders take their body color from the active palette.

### Sprite Fountain 💫🎶✨👾 · 2D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/SpriteFountainEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Sprite Fountain effect preview">

A fountain that throws the project's whole sprite cast: fish, Pacman and his ghosts, toasters and toast, and the three invaders, launched from the floor on a sweeping nozzle and falling back under gravity. The art is shared with the effects that introduced it, so a fix to a fish fixes it in both places.

- `lift`: how hard the nozzle throws; it scales with the grid.
- `pull`: gravity. 3 gives a two-second arc, long enough to read a toaster.
- `rate`: sprites launched per beat of the emit clock.
- `emitBpm`: launches per minute, so the plume's density is a choice.
- `size`: integer magnification per art pixel.
- `audioReactive`: one sprite per band, so the cast maps onto the spectrum.

Colors come from the active palette, one per sprite, held for its whole flight.

### Pong 💫🎵👾 · 2D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/PongEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Pong effect preview">

Two paddles rallying a ball, the attract mode of the 1972 original where both players are the machine. A perfect tracker would rally forever and never look like a game, so each paddle has a reaction delay and a small aiming error, re-rolled every exchange. That is what produces the occasional point.

- `rallyBpm`: ball crossings per minute, the same time on any grid.
- `paddle`: length as a percentage of the court; short paddles miss more.
- `reflex`: how sharply a paddle chases. Below full it lags a fast ball.
- `size`: integer magnification, when the ball is a sprite.
- `spriteBall`: swap the square for a sprite, re-picked on every hit.
- `audioReactive`: the ball advances only on the beat, in time with the track.

Uses the global palette.

### Aurora 💫🖌️🌫️🎡 · 3D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/AuroraEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Aurora effect preview">

Several noise fields, each on its own clock, read in polar coordinates and composited into curtains of light. Nothing is simulated: layers of one field at different scales interfere, and that is what reads as curtains folding through one another. The strongest layer at each pixel wins, so they stay distinct rather than averaging into haze.

- `speed`: master rate; every layer scales from it, and 0 freezes it.
- `scale`: noise cells across the grid; low is broad, high is fine.
- `layers`: how many fields are composited, and the main cost knob.
- `warp`: how far the field displaces its own angle, folding a curtain over.
- `twist`: how much the radius shears the angle, giving the curtains their lean.
- `segments`: kaleidoscope wedges; 1 leaves the composition unfolded.
- `contrast`: how much of the field lights; low is cloud, high is sharp.
- `octaves`: detail within each layer, multiplying the cost knob.
- `polarTable`, `polarTable16`: as PolarNoise above.

### Ballpit 💫✨ · 2D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/BallpitEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Ballpit effect preview">

Falling balls that pile up and shove each other aside. The heap is emergent: gravity pulls, the floor stops, and contact between neighbors makes the shape. `tilt` turns the pit into a slope and the pile slides and re-settles.

- `balls`: how many share the pit.
- `gravity`: how hard they fall.
- `size`: contact radius in pixels: how far apart balls sit when touching.
- `bounce`: restitution: how much speed a contact keeps.
- `tilt`: sideways force, turning the pit into a slope.
- `drag`: damping, so the heap settles instead of sloshing.

Collisions are the one non-linear part of the particle kernel, so the pool is small.

Two color fields trade places pixel by pixel in an order that looks random but is computed, so the transition needs no per-pixel state and no shuffled index list. Two devices rendering the same frame dissolve identically without exchanging anything.

- `bpm`: how fast one transition completes.
- `spread`: how long pixels spend mid-flight; 0 gives a hard edge.
- `eased`: ease the progress instead of sweeping linearly.
- `scatter`: random order; off gives a positional wipe from the same code.

The previous frame fed back through a zoom and rotation, dimmed, with a bright source drawn on top: trails that spiral away from themselves, like a camera pointed at its own monitor.

- `bpm`: how fast the source orbits.
- `zoom`: how much the feedback grows each frame.
- `rotate`: rotation per frame, which turns the trail into a spiral.
- `decay`: how fast the echo fades; higher is a shorter trail.
- `size`: radius of the bright source.

Shows that feedback is not a primitive: once the grid can be read as a texture (`sampleWrap`), the whole family of trails, zoom blur and smear is a few lines.

An audio analyser with real meter ballistics: bars rise fast enough to catch a transient and fall slowly enough to read, and a peak dot marks the recent maximum and drifts down.

- `attack`: how fast a bar rises toward a new level.
- `release`: how fast it falls back.
- `peakDecay`: how fast the peak dot drifts down.
- `showPeaks`: draw the floating peak dots.
- `colorByColumn`: color per band instead of by height.

The asymmetry is the whole point; a symmetric follower either misses the hit or flickers.

A maze of interlocking arcs that never repeats, drawn without storing a single tile. Randomly turned tiles join into continuous winding paths across the surface: the pattern looks designed, and nothing designed it.

- `bpm`: how fast the pattern drifts.
- `scale`: tiles across the short side.
- `thickness`: how fat the arcs are.
- `softness`: edge softness: the anti-aliasing width.
- `shuffle`: reshuffles which way the tiles face.
- `drift`: slide the pattern instead of holding still.

**The representative 2D shader**: no 3D, no rays, no float, and cheap on any target.

### Fluid 💫🖌️🌊💨 · 3D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/FluidEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Fluid effect preview">

Light poured into a simulated medium and carried by it. Every other flow here is a function of position and time; this one is state, so a jet fired now changes where everything downstream goes for seconds afterwards.

- `jets`: how many places light is poured in.
- `force`: how hard each one pushes the medium.

### Nebula 💫🖌️💨🌫️ · 3D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/NebulaEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Nebula effect preview">

A noise field decides where light is born, a curl flow decides where it goes, and between them the cloud keeps folding into itself. The emitter is a field rather than a handful of dots, so light enters everywhere at once and the flow shapes a whole cloud instead of drawing trails.

- `speed`: how fast the medium moves, and with it the whole cloud.
- `scale`: the field's cell size; low is broad clouds, high is wisps.
- `contrast`: what fraction of the field is bright enough to be born.
- `persistence`: how long light survives once it is in the flow, as a half-life.
- `octaves`: detail within the field, and its cost knob.
- `fieldScale`: compute the field at half or quarter resolution and stretch it.
- `fieldRate`: recompute the field every N frames; the flow still runs each one.

Held at 16 bits and dithered on the way out, which keeps a slow fade smooth.

Origin: MoonLight original, composing the noise-field and curl-flow kernels: the contrast window is Aurora's, in the shader vocabulary Stefan Petrick made recognizable in the LED world, and the flow is Bridson's curl noise (SIGGRAPH 2007)

### Trails 💫🖌️💨🌫️ · 3D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/TrailsEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Trails effect preview">

Dots thrown into a moving medium, leaving tails the flow carries and bends. Nothing draws a tail: it is the previous frames' dots, transported along a velocity field and dimmed, which is why the flow's shape is visible in it. On a cube each depth slice gets its own flow.

- `speed`: how fast the medium moves, and with it every tail.
- `dots`: how many emitters are throwing light in.
- `scale`: the flow field's cell size; low is broad sweeps, high is eddies.
- `persistence`: how long a tail survives, as a half-life.
- `breathe`: how much the flow's strength rises and falls.

The trail plane is 16-bit, which is what lets a tail fade smoothly rather than stepping.

A texture mapped onto the inside of an infinite tube, so the viewer appears to fly down it forever. Nothing is 3D: the angle around the center is one texture coordinate and the reciprocal of the distance is the other, which is perspective for the price of a divide.

- `bpm`: how fast the tunnel flies past.
- `depth`: texture scale along the tunnel; higher is finer rings.
- `twist`: rotation per unit depth, so the tunnel corkscrews.
- `segments`: kaleidoscope the wall; 1 leaves it plain.
- `octaves`: wall texture detail, and the cost knob.
- `vignette`: darken toward the vanishing point so it reads as receding.

- `bpm`: rotation speed.

- `spread`: how far apart the balls sit.
- `distance`: how far the object is from the viewer.

A propagating wave simulation: drops land, their rings spread outward, reflect off the edges and interfere where they cross. The crossing is what a drawn ripple cannot fake, because two rings meeting have to add and cancel.

- `speed`: simulation steps per second: how fast the water itself moves.
- `dropRate`: how often drops land, in time rather than per frame.
- `damping`: how fast waves lose energy; higher is calmer water.
- `strength`: how hard a drop hits.
- `colorByHeight`: color by height, so crests and troughs read differently.

A lit 3D scene rendered by marching a ray through a distance field, one ray per pixel. Nothing draws a sphere: the scene is a function returning the distance to the nearest surface, and the spheres emerge where each ray stops.

- `bpm`: how fast the scene animates.
- `steps`: ray marching steps: the quality and cost knob.
- `blend`: how much the two spheres melt into each other.
- `cameraY`: camera height above the floor.
- `showFloor`: include the ground plane.

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/PolarNoiseEffect.gif" width="300" alt="PolarNoise effect preview">

A warped noise field addressed by angle and radius, folded into a kaleidoscope. The field turns and breathes around the center rather than scrolling past it.

- `bpm`: how fast the field drifts.
- `scale`: noise cells across the grid; low is broad, high is fine detail.
- `segments`: kaleidoscope wedges; 1 disables the fold.
- `warp`: domain-warp strength; 0 gives a plain field.
- `octaves`: fbm octaves, and the main cost knob.
- `twist`: how much the radius shears the angle, setting the spiral.
- `polarTable`: read each pixel's angle and radius from a table, 2 bytes each.
- `polarTable16`: hold that table at full precision, at 4 bytes per pixel.

Cost scales with `octaves` and `warp`: at `warp` > 0 and `octaves` 2 it is roughly 4 noise samples per pixel. On a large wall set `octaves` to 1 or `warp` to 0, which degrades to a plain polar noise that still reads well.

A circle and a box orbit and melt into each other, drawn as signed distance fields rather than outlines. One distance per pixel yields three looks at once: a smooth fill, an outline, and a glow falling off into the field.

- `bpm`: orbit speed.
- `radius`: circle radius, as a fraction of the short side.
- `boxSize`: box half-extent, same scale.
- `blend`: melt radius; 0 unions the shapes hard.
- `outline`: 0 fills the shape; higher draws an outline of that width.
- `glow`: tint the field around the shape by distance.

- `script`: which `.mle` file runs, picked from the library and edited here.
- Every control the script declares, editable live without a recompile.

### AudioSpectrum 💫🎶

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/AudioSpectrumEffect.gif" width="300" alt="AudioSpectrum effect preview">

The 16 mic frequency bands spread across X, each column lit bottom-up by its magnitude.

- `colorMode`: bars colored by `height`, the VU look, or `per-band`, a rainbow.

### BeatRipples 💫🎶🖌️ · 2D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/BeatRipplesEffect.gif" width="300" alt="BeatRipples effect preview">

Every beat is a stone dropped in water. A real wave simulation, which gives what a drawn expanding circle cannot: ripples that pass through each other, reflect off the walls and interfere into standing patterns. The loudest band decides where the stone lands, so a bass hit falls near the center and a treble hit out at the rim, and its strength sets how deep.

- `damping`: how long the water keeps ringing.
- `drop`: how deep a beat's stone falls.
- `rain`: idle drops when there is no music, so the surface is alive in silence.
- `shine`: how strongly the slope lights the surface.

### Pulse 💫🎶 · 3D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/PulseEffect.gif" width="300" alt="Pulse effect preview">

Shells expanding from a drifting origin, one per beat: a pair of fronts on a strip, a ring on a panel, a sphere in a volume. Sound fires one and its pitch colors it, and an idle clock keeps them arriving in a silent room. The effect a device boots with.

- `bpm`: pulses a minute while nothing is heard, where 0 waits for sound alone.
- `speed`: how fast a shell crosses the layout, at any layout size.
- `thickness`: the shell's width, as a share of the layout rather than in lights.
- `audioGain`: how strongly sound fires a pulse, where 0 ignores it.
- `drift`: how far the origin wanders from the center, where 0 pins it there.

Compare with [BeatRipples](#beatripples), which simulates water on a plane. This one draws a moving front, which carries it into 1D and 3D.

### VuMeters 💫🎶🖌️ · 3D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/VuMetersEffect.gif" width="300" alt="VuMeters effect preview">

Sixteen needles, one per band, each with real mass. What makes a VU meter beautiful is not the dial, it is the needle: it overshoots a peak, swings back and settles, which is why a mechanical meter reads as alive where a bar graph reads as a readout.

The bass needles are heavier than the treble ones, so the low end swings and the high end flickers.

- `damping`: how much the needle overshoots; high is a studio meter.
- `response`: how hard the needle chases the signal at all.
- `peakHold`: how long the peak marker stays up, as a half-life.
- `smooth`: drive from the meter ballistic rather than the raw band.

### RadialSpectrum 💫🎶🖌️🎡 · 3D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/RadialSpectrumEffect.gif" width="300" alt="RadialSpectrum effect preview">

The spectrum as ripples. Each band owns a sector around the center, mirrored left and right with the bass at top and bottom. Sound is born at the center and travels outward, so the radius is time and a ring's length is that band's recent history. Every sector is one band, so a band that is stuck shows as a sector that never moves. On a cube the ripples are expanding shells.

- `speed`: how fast sound travels outward, a ring every 10 to 105 ms.
- `persistence`: how far out a ripple stays visible.
- `smooth`: read the meter ballistic rather than the raw bands.
- `beat`: a white shockwave born at the center on every onset.
- `polarTable`, `polarTable16`, `mapping`: the polar address, and its shape.

### DemoReel 💫 · 3D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/DemoReelEffect.gif" width="300" alt="DemoReel effect preview">

Plays every other registered effect in turn, auto-advancing on a timer, so one Layer cycles the whole library hands-free. New effects are picked up automatically. It can pick a fresh palette each cycle and overlay the playing effect's name, and the status line says which is playing. It never hosts itself, and it plays in sequence rather than compositing.

- `interval`: seconds each effect plays before advancing (1–120).
- `shuffle`: jump to a random next effect instead of registry order.
- `randomPalette`: pick a random palette on each cycle; on by default.
- `showName`: overlay the playing effect's name in a small font; default on.

Receives lights over UDP and writes them into the layer: the receive side for Resolume, Madrix, xLights and LedFx.

- `universe_start`: the first incoming universe to map, mirroring the sender.
- `channels_per_universe`: bytes each universe maps to; 510 or 512.

### FseqPlayer 🎞️ · 3D

<img src="../../assets/light/effects/FseqPlayerEffect.gif" width="300" alt="FseqPlayer effect preview">

Plays pre-rendered FSEQ animations from the SD card, with a playlist and the standard transport (play/pause/stop/previous/next, shuffle, loop-one/all/off). FSEQ carries no pixel semantics of its own, so this effect maps each frame's byte stream onto the layer buffer in channel order, 2D and 3D alike. Zlib-compressed files decode via the ESP32 ROM at no flash cost; zstd is not yet supported.

- `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `previous`, `next`: the transport.
- `shuffle`: advance to a random track instead of playlist order.
- `loopMode`: `off` (stop after one pass), `one` (repeat), `all` (loop forever).
- `fps`: the playback rate (1-120, default 30); the file's own rate is unused.
- `playlist`: the tracks to play, picked from any file found on the card.
- `position`: the current track's frame position.
- `rescan`: re-scan the whole SD card for new or removed `.fseq` files.

R/G/B each follow a sine along one axis at 120° phase offset: a glowing, scrolling color box.

- `frequency`: spatial frequency, waves across the box (1–20).
- `amplitude`: peak brightness (0–255, 255 = full).
- `bpm`: scroll speed.
