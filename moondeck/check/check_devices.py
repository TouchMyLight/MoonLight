"""Validate the installer device catalog (mooninstaller/deviceModels.json).

The catalog is hand-maintained data consumed identically by three clients (the
web installer, the device UI's ?deviceModel= inject, and MoonDeck), so a typo drifts
silently: a broken image path, a device name that no longer matches its
System.deviceModel control, a driver pin list on an entry that has no driver. This is the
catalog's counterpart to check_specs.py for module docs: a fast, dependency-free
gate that pins the invariants the clients assume.

Invariants checked per entry:
  - required fields present (name, chip, firmwares, modules)
  - firmwares is a non-empty list of non-empty strings (entry[0] is the default)
  - image (if set) is a local assets/deviceModels/ path that resolves on disk
  - url (if set) is an absolute http(s) link
  - the System module's `deviceModel` control value equals the entry `name`
  - every module `type` is factory-registered (or a known boot-wired singleton)
  - a driver's `pins` control only appears on an actual *LedDriver module
  - supported/planned (if set) are string arrays drawn from the known vocabulary

Exit 1 on any error, mirroring check_specs.py.
